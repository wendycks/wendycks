👋 Hello, I'm Wendy Cheung (@wendycks)

🔍 Passionate about cartography, I love both sharing and discovering new mapping techniques.

🌿 Currently diving into the world of geomatics to broaden my expertise.

🔥 Seeking collaboration on projects related to wildfires and remote sensing applications. Let's innovate together to make a difference!

⚡ Fun fact: I'm enchanted by the Douglas fir's unique plate-shaped bark—it's simply adorable! Also, I'm a devoted fan of the Duffy and Friends toyline at Disney. There’s always room in my collection for more!

Let’s connect and explore the potential of geomatics and environmental conservation together!
